When the application starts, you will be asked to enter a grid size and width on the console, please do so.

Secondly, take note that the enemies by default do not move (in order to allow the player to adjust the camera before starting).
Ennemies can be forced to move by pressing the 'Q' button on the keyboard.

Features:
- User defined Grid size
- Moving enemies that reset the game when pacman touches them and that change colours costantly
- Window size rehandling that conserves aspect ratio
- world axes shown at origin
- Consumables disapear when pacman eats them
- Pacman can be moved with WASD keys.
- Perspective camera that pans when right mouse button is clicked, tilts when middle button is held or zooms in/out when left button is clicked.
- Rendering mode can change between Points, Lines, Triangles (by pressing keys 'P', 'L' and 'T' respectively)
- Entities on the grid can scale up and down using 'U' or 'J' keys.
- Arrow keys on keyboard make the world rotate and pressing "Home" resets its orientation
- Pressing spacebar places pacman on any random empty grid point

Code Structure:
- The terrain is autogenerated using triangle strips and the grid is painted over it using the terrain shader.
- The playing grid is managed by the GridManager object that assigns a GridPoint to each line intersection.
- Each GridPoint knows only what is currently on it and GridEntities (enemies, pacman, consumables) can try to attach/detach to them depending on their movements/placements
- Most of the object loading code provided in the sample code was moved into the GridEntity class
- The GridAxis axes are also autogenerated and get their colours from the axis.vert and axis.frag shaders
- Most of the Camera functionality was moved to the Camera class and edited by me to allow camera manipulation
- Almost the entirety of the shader code provided was moved into the Shader class except for the setting of Uniforms which still needs to be done outside in the Main
